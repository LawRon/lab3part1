Summary of Open source project:

Simply enough my project is one that would alter the details pane in windows explorer
to allow for the display of a selected folder, or folders, size.
Normally in order to get the folder size, one has to hover over the folder icon for an annoying period
of time, or open the properties context menu.
By placing the information in the details pane upon selection, this streamlines the obtaining of data.
